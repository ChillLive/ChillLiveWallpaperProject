**<div align="center">Illuminate your screen with light pastel colors and scenes that change slowly over the course of the day**</div>

## :mountain: A Chill live wallpaper?

_This little app is meant to transport you to different lands, where trees sway in the wind and countless stars twinkle at night.
Every day, the Sun and the Moon rise and set at times based on your location, illuminating the scene in soft pastel colors. Through the year, the amount of snow and the color of the scene will change based on the season._

_Enable the dynamic weather feature and see your wallpaper adjust throughout the day based on your surroundings._

_This app is 100% ad free, and your data stays on your device._
_You can use this app as a light/dark automatic mode. The battery consumption is optimized and you shouldn't notice any big difference compared to a standard wallpaper._

  _Just relax, choose your wallpaper and start the journey!_
  
  [Dowload the app on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chilllive.chillwallpaperproject)

## :last_quarter_moon: How to use

<img align="right" src="/Assets/showcaseGif.gif" width="200" height="450">

**2. Live location and weather**

* Enable dynamic weather updates based on your location
* Change the weather manually

## :hatching_chick: What's next?
I have many ideas to implement, such as:
* ~~More parallax settings~~ - _implemented_
* Different landscapes and scenes - _2 different scenes implemented, with many variations_
* More color varieties
* Details like the rainbows, more cloud varieties, and so much more
* ~~Weather system~~ - _implemented_

## :exclamation: Disclaimer
This app is still in development. Therefore, you might encounter unexpected behaviors, bugs and performance issues.
As a non professional app developer and working on this project as a hobby on my free time, implementing some new features might take time, or maybe not happen at all.
Please keep this in mind when using this app.

## :sun_behind_small_cloud: Known issues
If you notice issues that are not in this list, please first check if your app is up to date. I often push new releases with experimental content that can sometimes break some features, or bring unwanted behaviors. When I notice it, I try to patch it as fast as I can. Your problem might be already solved in the newer versions of the app.

If your problem isn't listed here, feel free to check the issue tab and open a new ticket :)

* Scrolling can be slow, or even not happen on less powerful/older device. This is due to overdrawing scene layer/elements at high frame rate _This issue is not 100% solved, but was drastically improved._
* Scrolling is not enabled in landscape mode _At the moment, I am not considering a fix for this._
* The contrast between the text and the background can be sometimes low, making it hard to read the options or other elements
* On certain devices, the app can sometimes consume an insane amount of battery. It should normally use 1% of battery per day, not more
* Sometimes, the background is not correct when pulling the drawer. _I don't know how to fix this issue. ChaptGTP either!_
